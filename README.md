## Android Code Challenge Submissions

In this repository we will store code challenge submissions from candidates for open positions in the Android team.

----------

### Adding a Submission

#### Creating a new branch
Push a submission as a new branch. 
The branch name should follow the following pattern:

`{team}/{candidate-name}`

An example would be, if the candidate's name is *damian-burke* and they are applying to the news team:

`news/damian-burke`

#### Opening a Pull Request
The base of our code challenge is in the **base** branch.
After pushing the code challenge submission into the candidate's branch, open up a pull request from the newly created branch to the base branch.

For example, a pull request from 

`news/damian-burke` into `base`

This allows us to easily review changes made by the candidates.

----------

### Reviewing a Submission

Use the opened pull request for the candidate for the review. 
Feel free to add comments and questions to the open pull request.
