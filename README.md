# Android Take Home Test

The purpose of this test is to evaluate your technical skills, communication and mindset.

You should exemplify the :muscle: best work you can do with the provided example and perhaps :boom: surprise us with your solution. You have *one* week time to work on the test, but this our expectations are a function of the time needed for the test.

You are expected to refactor and improve the project to avoid mistakes it has.

## Procedure

1. After completing the challenge, clean the project (builds, .gradle, etc). But remember: The project should still be runnable.
2. Compress project file as a ".zip" file.
3. Send the `zip` file back to the person you have been in contact with (from the recruiting team).
4. You will receive feedback for this project file which you sent us during the live interview.

Notes :
   - Meaningful commit history (git) will be a plus.
   - Feel free to add some comments or provide information in readme.md file about things you would like to improve but didn't have time for this.
   - The project zip file size should't be more 15 MB.

## Project

In this project, you will have a news feed activity. It retrieves the data from the local JSON file.
JSON is parsed manually and elements has been created from the parsed data. 

All the logical operations are happening in `MyNewsActivity.kt` file and all the visual creation for the list items is happening in `news_item.xml` file. 
There is only one data class for `News` element and it's in model folder.

Application is written in Kotlin.

You are free to suggest any library or code snippet that you think that is going to be useful for the codebase. 
But please be sure add detailed information about your suggestions and why would they be useful.
